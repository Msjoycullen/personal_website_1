    		<p>Hello, this is Joy, a third-year Computer Science and Statistics student at the University of Waterloo. <p>
    		<p>I am naturally curious and excited about new technologies, with a particular interest in data science and distributed data systems and rich experience in full stack web development. I am most comfortable with C/C++/Ruby and have also worked with Python, C#, Java and JavaScript. I hope to dig deeper into the world of data and gain more research-oriented experiences.</p>
    		<p>I am also a bilingual writer &#38; amateur photographer and played Chinese zither for 14 years. It is always exhilarating to record the sheer beauty of nature with a camera, the intertwining thoughts and sudden inspirations with a pen, and the most complex inner feelings with music. </p>
    		<p>If you feel a connection and wish to talk, please feel free to click on any of the links below. And make sure to check my gallery (just started on a new platform but will be sharing tons of awesome photos)!</p>
